This is the student profile for the older group of students you have to teach.

- Their ages are 16-17.
- They can be taught with harder examples.
- They can be challenged with harder questions.
- They don't like being shouted at.
- They can understand the topic best with analogies for hard topics.
- They can be taught with abstract theories with occasional games.
- They have good English and can understand jargon but they don't like it when everything is said using jargon.
- Their Maths abilities are good but not excellent, so they often need guidance for hard topics.
