Key points for 1st Year Biology topic the Digestive System.

- Terminology
- - Ingestion : taking in food.
- - Digestion : breaking down food.
- - Absorption : taking digestied food from our intestines into our blood.
- - Assimilation : using the food in the cells of the body.
-- Egestion : discharge of undigested waste.
-- Enzyme : a chemical (made of protein) produced by the body that speeds up chemical reactions in the body without being used up.
-- Catalyst : a substance that speeds up reactions.
-- Amylase : an enzyme in saliva that breaks down starch.
-- Maltose : a simple sugar that starch breaks down into.
-- Oesophagus : a muscular tube ,also called food pipe, that pushes food down it into the stomach.
-- Peristalsis : a wave-like movement of muscles in the body.
-- Fibre : material not broken down or digested by enzymes in our digestive system.
-- Stomach : a muscular bag that holds food for a few hours.
-- Organs : 
-- Small intestine : 
-- Liver 
-- Bile : 
-- Pancreas : 
-- Large intesine : 
-- Faeces : 

- The digestive system consists of :
-- The mouth
-- The epiglottis
-- The oesophagus
-- The liver
-- The stomach
-- The pancreas
-- The small intestine
-- The large intestine
-- The rectum
-- The anus
- Digestion is the breakdown of food. The digestive system, alimentary canal, is a tube that starts at the mouth and ends at the anus.
- Digestion is needed so that small molecules of food can pass from our intestines into our blood.
- Food that does not pass into the bloodstream forms waste called faeces.
- The mouth takes in and digests food. 
- The 2 types of digestion: 
Physical digestion = the mechanical breakdown of food.
Chemical digestion = the breakdown of food using enzymes and hydrochloric acid.
- Our teeth physically digest food when we chew.
- Our four types of teeth:
-- Incisors = cut and slice food
-- Canines = grip and tear food
-- Premolars = chew and crush food
-- Molars = chew and crush food
- Chemical digestion in the mouth happens with saliva.
- It contains an enzyme called amylase that breaks down starch into maltose.
- Oesophagus - what it is, function
- Stomach - what it is, functions
- Small intestine - what it is, function, most digestion takes place here
- Liver - what it is, production of bile
- BIle - green/brown liquid that breaks down fat.
- Pancreas - what it is, function
- Large intestine - an organ that reabsorbs water into the bloodstream.
- Faeces - what it is
- Rectum and anus = egestion of faeces
