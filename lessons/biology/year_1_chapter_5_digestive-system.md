Key points for 1st Year Biology topic the Digestive System.

Terminology
- - Ingestion : taking in food.
- - Digestion : breaking down food.
- - Absorption : taking digestied food from our intestines into our blood.
- - Assimilation : using the food in the cells of the body.
- - Egestion : discharge of undigested waste.
- - Enzyme : a chemical (made of protein) produced by the body that speeds up chemical reactions in the body without being used up.
- - Catalyst : a substance that speeds up reactions.
- - Amylase : an enzyme in saliva that breaks down starch.
- - Maltose : a simple sugar that starch breaks down into.
- - Oesophagus : a muscular tube ,also called food pipe, that pushes food down it into the stomach.
- - Peristalsis : a wave-like movement of muscles in the body.
- - Fibre : material not broken down or digested by enzymes in our digestive system.
- - Stomach : a muscular bag that holds food for a few hours.
- - Organs : a group of cells that have a specific function. 
- - Small intestine : an organ below the stomach that contains enzymes, where most digestion takes place and most absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream takes place.
- - Liver : a large organ located to the right of the stomach carrying out many functions including the production of bile.
- - Bile : a green/brown liquid produced by the liver that digests fat.
- - Pancreas : an organ located near the stomach that produces digestive enzymes, they flow from the pancreas to the small intestine.
- - Large intesine : an organ that reabsorbs water into the bloodstream.

The digestive system consists of :
- - The mouth
- - The epiglottis
- - The oesophagus
- - The liver
- - The stomach
- - The pancreas
- - The small intestine
- - The large intestine
- - The rectum
- - The anus
- Digestion is the breakdown of food. The digestive system, alimentary canal, is a tube that starts at the mouth and ends at the anus.
- Digestion is needed so that small molecules of food can pass from our intestines into our blood.
- Food that does not pass into the bloodstream forms waste called faeces.
- The mouth takes in and digests food. 
- The 2 types of digestion: 
- - Physical digestion = the mechanical breakdown of food.
- - Chemical digestion = the breakdown of food using enzymes and hydrochloric acid.

- Our teeth physically digest food when we chew.
- Our four types of teeth:
- - Incisors = cut and slice food
- - Canines = grip and tear food
- - Premolars = chew and crush food
- - Molars = chew and crush food
- Chemical digestion in the mouth happens with saliva.
- It contains an enzyme called amylase that breaks down starch into maltose.

- Stomach - what it is, functions
- Small intestine - what it is, function, most digestion takes place here
- Liver - what it is, production of bile
- BIle - green/brown liquid that breaks down fat.
- Pancreas - what it is, function
- If too much water is absorbed, the faeces will be too solid (constipation).
- If too less water is absorbed, the faeces will be too liquid (diarrhoea).
- Rectum : stores faeces.
- Anus : egestion of faeces
