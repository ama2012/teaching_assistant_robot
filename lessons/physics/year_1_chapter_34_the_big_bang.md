Key points for 1st Year Earth and Space topic The Big Bang.

Terminology
- - Galaxies : a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.
- - Solar System : consists of a sun and everything that orbits it.
- - Astronomer : a person who studies astronomy.
- - Expanding universe : the discovery that all objects in the universe are moving away from each other.
- - Singularity : a zone that was the origin of the universe, it is very very small, very very dense and very very hot.
- - Gravity :  a force that pulls particles together. 

- The universe is a huge area of space within which all the galaxies, stars and solar systems are found.
- Scientists believe there was a beginning to the universe.
- The most accepted theory of the beginning of the universe is The Big Bang.
- In 1929, US astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was expanding.
- Hubble's Law : Galaxies are moving away from each other. The further away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us.
- The Hubble Space Telescope, which was launched in 1990 by NASA is named after Edwin Hubble.
- The images we see on Earth of space are distorted by Earth's atmosphere.
- The Hubble Space Telescope orbits the Earth at a height of 569km so the images are not affected by the atmosphere.
- Despite its name, there wasn't an explosion at the start of the universe.
- Edwin Hubble concluded that there must have been a single point when the entire universe was held within a single zone.
- Scientists call this single zone the singularity.
- Within a single moment this intensely hot singularity expanded rapidly. This is the Big Bang.

Timeline
- - 13.8 billion years ago : The Big Bang.
- - A few seconds later : Birth of subatomic particles.
- - 380 thousand years later : Electrons and nuclei pulled together by gravity to create atoms. The Dark Ages.
- - 300 million years later : Stars start to form.
- - 1 billion years later : Galaxies start to form.
- - 9 billion years later : The solar system forms.

- After the Big Bang, the universe started to cool as it expanded.
- The cooler temperature allowed forces to exist, gravity was one of them.
- It pulled together subatomic particles to form atoms. The atoms were then pulled together to form bigger things like stars.
- Evidence to support the Big Bang are expanding universe and the way the elements were created.
- The universe's expansion is slowing down in comparison to the start.
- This led to theories about how the universe might end.
- The Big Freeze : the universe will keep on expanding until it gets so large that there is not enough heat energy in the universe, then everything will freeze and there will be no more life.
- The Big Crunch : the universe will reach its maximum size and then like an elastic band it will snap back into a singularity.

Summary questions
Explain what is meant by the Big Bang. When did the Big Bang happen?
- The Big Bang is the thoery that the whole universe started as a singularity that suddenly began expanding. It happened about 13.8 billion years ago.

Explain the words 'astronomy' and 'astronomer'.
- 'Astronomy' is the study of the universe and an 'astronomer' is someone who studies astronomy.

Outline Hubble's Law.
- Galaxies are moving away from each other. The further away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us.

Explain the term 'singularity'.
- A singularity is a very very small, very very dense, very very hot.

Describe why telescopes on Earth can receive distorted images of objects in space.
- Telescopes on Earth can get blurry or distorted images because the light from space has to pass through Earth's atmosphere, and the air  moves around and bends the light in different ways.

Write out the sequence of events of the Big Bang.
- 13.8 billion years ago : The Big Bang.
- A few seconds later : Birth of subatomic particles.
- 380 thousand years later : Electrons and nuclei pulled together by gravity to create atoms. The Dark Ages.
- 300 million years later : Stars start to form.
- 1 billion years later : Galaxies start to form.
- 9 billion years later : The solar system forms.

From your research, list the main scientific discoveries that support the theory of the Big Bang.
- Expanding universe and how the elements are formed.

Explain why telescopes in space provide better information than telescopes on Earth.
- Telescopes in space are not affected by the Earth's atmosphere, therefore providing better and clearer images.
